        "question": "In January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks of service from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?",
        "answer_a": " When a court finds that a party has breached a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages in accordance with the contract terms. Where the breaching party has committed a total breach of contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that are intended to place the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied but for the breach. In this case, the parties contracted for the teacher to work 10 weeks at the summer camp for $10,000. When the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed, the camp had committed a total breach of contract. Therefore, the teacher should recover damages in the amount of $10,000.",
        "answer_b": "The teacher is entitled to be put in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. Application of this principle leads to recovery of the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), PLUS the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 travel expenses). Mitigation expenses can be recovered, if reasonable, even if those particular expenses are not connected to a successful mitigation attempt.",

At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others.

To be criminally liable for the actions of another, a person must have the intent that the actions be committed and aid or abet in the commission of the offense.

        "question": "A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant by written lease for two years ending on the last day of a recent month. The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?",
        "answer_a": " An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (the \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. An assignment by a tenant does not discharge the original landlord's lien",
        "answer_b": "An assignment arises when a tenant transfers all or some of the leased premises to another for the remainder of the lease term, retaining no interest in the assigned premises. In this case, prior to the agreement with the friend, the tenant had privity of contract with the landlord because of the lease. The tenant also had privity of estate because the tenant was in possession of the apartment. Subsequently, an assignment arose when the tenant transferred the premises to the friend for the remainder of the lease term of nine months. The friend was then in privity of estate with the landlord as to all promises that run with the land, including the covenant to pay rent. The tenant was not released by the landlord, however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract.",

The plaintiff called an expert witness who based his testimony solely on his own professional experience but also asserted, when asked, that the book Smith on Milling Systems was a reliable treatise in the field and consistent with his views. On cross-examination, the defendant asked the witness whether he and Smith were ever wrong. The witness answered, \"Nobody's perfect.\" The defendant asked no further questions. The defendant called a second expert witness and asked, \"Do you accept the Smith book as reliable?\" The second witness said, \"It once was, but it is now badly out of date.\" The plaintiff requested that the jury be allowed to examine the book and judge for itself the book's reliability.

        "question": "A lumber supplier agreed to sell and a furniture manufacturer agreed to buy all of the lumber that the manufacturer required over a two-year period. The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?",
        "answer_a": " The UCC defines an adequate assurance of due performance as \"such security for the performance of the contract for the sale of goods as is sufficient to indemnify the buyer against loss in the event of breach by the seller.\" A seller is entitled to require assurances of performance if the seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the buyer's performance. The supplier was entitled to seek assurances because it had received reliable information that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The credit report and audited financial statements provided by the manufacturer were sufficient to provide assurance of due performance and support resumption of deliveries. Thus",
        "answer_b": "A party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurances of performance, pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-609. The supplier in this case did so, but the information provided by the manufacturer would be regarded as satisfying the request for an assurance of performance.

        "question": "A toy manufacturer that has its headquarters and sole manufacturing plant in the state of Green developed a \"Martian\" toy that simulates the exploration of Mars by a remote-controlled vehicle. It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?",
        "answer_a": " The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. Protectionism is a policy of protecting domestic producers from foreign competition by imposing restrictions on imports. A protectionist policy is prohibited by the commerce clause. A state law that has a protectionist effect on interstate commerce is invalid. A state law that has an adverse effect on interstate commerce, even if it is not protectionist, is invalid if it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce. The test for determining whether a state law has an adverse effect on interstate commerce is whether it has a substantial effect on the economy of the interstate market. A state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market is invalid if it is not necessary to serve a legitimate state interest. A state law that protects the health or safety of its residents is considered to serve a legitimate state interest. Therefore, a state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market in toys is invalid unless it is necessary to protect the health or safety of the state's residents. Protecting the health and safety of the state's residents justifies any burden on the interstate toy market, so a state law that has a substantial effect on that market is valid if it is designed to protect the health and safety of the state's residents. In this case, the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that the toys it sells satisfy scientific criteria justifies the burden on the interstate toy market. Therefore, the law is constitutional.",
        "answer_b": "The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law. The state law therefore violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.",

The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed.

The words of the landowner included \"this is yours,\" showing the necessary intent to strip himself of dominion and control over the deed and to immediately transfer the title. In addition, handing the deed to the grantee raises a rebuttable presumption of delivery.

If the drug dealer is prosecuted in a common-law jurisdiction for attempted possession of cocaine, should he be convicted?",
        "answer_a": " The common law of attempt requires that the defendant have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the crime, and that the step have a natural tendency to bring about the commission of the crime. The drug dealer's agreement to sell the cocaine, even if sincere, was not a substantial step because it was part of an ongoing negotiation that was to continue for 10 days and it was not a step that had any natural tendency to bring about the commission of the crime. In modern statutory jurisdictions, however, attempt requires only that the defendant have the intent to commit the crime and that the defendant take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. So, Answer A is correct in a statutory jurisdiction.",
        "answer_b": "The common law of attempt required that the defendant commit some act (beyond mere \"preparation\") toward bringing about the intended crime. Wayne R. LaFave, Principles of Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4, at 442-49 (2003). Here, the drug dealer took no act, much less any act that would qualify at common law, toward obtaining the cocaine. See, e.g., People v. Warren, 489 N.E.2d 240 (N.Y. 1985) (finding no common law attempt on much stronger facts for prosecution than this fact pattern). Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no \"substantial step\" toward commission of the crime.

The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?",

The incident's bearing on the plaintiff's veracity is tenuous at best. Moreover, the incident's contradiction to the plaintiff's testimony is also tenuous.

As a general matter, a witness also can be impeached with evidence that contradicts a part of his testimony that bears on an important issue in dispute.

A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1 and, over the defendant's objection, the court entered a judgment of conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the state supreme court. The defendant seeks to overturn his conviction in a habeas corpus action in federal court, claiming his constitutional rights were violated by allowing a jury verdict that was not unanimous and by allowing a jury composed of fewer than 12 members. How is the federal court likely to rule in this action?",
        "answer_a": " The Constitution does not require a unanimous jury verdict where the state has a jury verdict law that allows a less than unanimous verdict. Here, the state has such a law, and the federal court will uphold the conviction. The Constitution does not require a jury composed of more than 12 members, either.

The granting clause of the instrument ran to the church \"and its successors forever, so long as the premises are used for church purposes.\" The church took possession of the land and used it as its site of worship for many years. Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title. The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grantor as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?",
        "answer_a": " The warranty deed conveyed a fee simple determinable title to the church and the grantor. The future interest retained by the grantor is a reversion. A title is unmarketable when it is encumbered by an interest that is not freely transferable. The buyer plans to use the land as a site for business purposes, which would cause the reversion to terminate. Therefore, the buyer cannot perform, and the church should prevail.",

The future interest becomes possessory immediately upon the occurrence of the limitation. A title is unmarketable when a reasonable person would not purchase it.

A pedestrian slipped on the frozen puddle and broke her leg. The pedestrian sued the car owner to recover for her injury. At trial, the only evidence the pedestrian offered as to negligence was the car owner's admission that she had violated the statute. At the conclusion of the proofs, both parties moved for a directed verdict. How should the trial judge proceed?",
        "answer_a": " The pedestrian's claim is that the car owner was negligent in causing the puddle to form. The pedestrian's claim is not that the car owner violated the statute; rather, it is that the car owner was negligent in the way she handled the water. The pedestrian's claim is that the car owner should have used sand to deice the area or should have waited until later in the day to wash her car. Because the pedestrian's claim is that the car owner was negligent, the court should deny both motions and submit the case to the jury. The jury can, but is not required to, draw the inference that the car owner was negligent from the fact that she violated the statute.

The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the police decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The police asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table. The woman is charged with possession of the heroin found on the living room table. She moves pretrial to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by virtue of an illegal search and seizure. Should the woman's motion be granted?",

Here, no such warrant existed. However, police may conduct a valid warrantless search if they have a valid exception to the warrant requirement. One exception is when a person consents to a search. Here, the facts indicate that the woman gave the officers permission to enter the house.

        "answer_a": " This is one of the few instances where prior bad acts can be used to impeach a witness. Evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by the witness can be used to impeach his current testimony if it is given under oath and subject to cross-examination. Because the gang member's prior testimony is inconsistent with his present assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony is impeachable. The gang member's prior inconsistent statement can be used to impeach his current testimony. The court is likely to admit testimony by a witness that the gang member is challenging the defendant's leadership role in the gang because this is inconsistent with his earlier testimony and is thus impeachable.",
        "answer_b": "This is evidence of \"bias.\" It shows that the declarant had a motive to implicate the defendant falsely, because by doing so he would remove the defendant from the position that he wanted to have. Evidence of bias is considered important and, generally speaking, it is liberally admitted. Note that the gang member can be impeached even though he is not at trial to testify. Federal Rule of Evidence 806 allows parties to impeach a hearsay declarant in the same ways that would be permitted if the declarant were to testify.

A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority.

The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.

        "answer_a": " The Fourth Amendment protects the driver from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state. The motion to suppress should be granted because there was no arrest for the traffic violation and no lawful arrest could be made on the basis of the warrant. A warrant is required for a search if the driver is arrested for the traffic violation, or if the police have probable cause to believe drugs are in the car. In this case, neither circumstance existed. The fact that the computer listed the warrant as outstanding was irrelevant; the warrant was quashed 10 days earlier and the clerk of the court had not updated the computer. Because there was no lawful arrest or valid warrant, the driver was unconstitutionally searched, and the evidence should be suppressed.",

        "question": "A rancher and a farmer own adjacent tracts of rural land. For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?",

An owner is entitled to use lateral water, to keep lateral water on his or her land, and to prevent lateral water from leaving his or her land. The farmer's dam prevents the natural flow of lateral water from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. Estoppel is not relevant to determining who owns the water. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the farmer's dam, not the rancher's previous impoundment of water, is the issue in this case. Answer D is incorrect because it is not relevant whether the water is natural or artificial. The farmer's dam, once built, is an artificial obstruction of the watercourse, and the farmer is estopped to claim ownership of the water above the dam. Answer C is correct.",
        "answer_b": "This water is diffuse surface water. Although there are different views regarding the way an owner may expel such water, an owner such as the farmer may impound such water, especially in the absence of any malice.",

It explicitly states that the farmer's dam is an artificial obstruction of the watercourse, which prevents the natural flow of lateral water from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. The explanation also mentions that the farmer is estopped to claim ownership of the water above the dam. On the other hand, Explanation B only states that the water is diffuse surface water and that an owner such as the farmer may impound such water, especially in the absence of any malice.

The needle broke because of a manufacturing defect that the dentist could not have detected. Is the patient likely to recover damages in an action against the dentist based on strict products liability and malpractice?",
        "answer_a": " Damages may be recovered for physical injuries caused by defective products, and damages may also be recovered for injuries caused by professional malpractice. In this case, the patient is likely to recover on both theories. The dentist's use of a defective needle was a proximate cause of the patient's injuries, and the dentist's failure to detect the defect would not constitute a defense to a strict products liability claim. Likewise, the patient's injury was a foreseeable consequence of the dentist's actions, and thus his malpractice is another basis upon which damages may be recovered. Thus, Answer D is correct.",

Assuming all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the bottling company succeed in recovering $40,000 in consequential damages from the wholesaler?",
        "answer_a": " The UCC defines an acceptance as a manifestation of agreement to a contract by a party against whom the offer is directed. An acceptance is effective upon dispatch if a mailed acceptance is a dispatch. The terms of the contract between the wholesaler and the bottling company arose from their course of dealing, the parties' tacit agreements, and the terms of the wholesaler's acknowledgement form. The bottling company's purchase order was an offer to enter into such a contract. The wholesaler's shipment of the bottles was an acceptance of the offer and formation of the contract. The terms of the contract included the disclaimer of consequential damages. The bottling company's subsequent use of the bottles and its incurrence of losses are relevant to the determination of whether the bottling company has breached the contract. However, the bottling company's breach is irrelevant because the contract's liquidated damages clause (in the form of the disclaimer) provides for the recovery of the loss the wholesaler incurred due to the bottling company's breach. The bottling company is not entitled to recover consequential damages because the contract did not permit such damages, and the contract's liquidated damages clause is enforceable.",

        "question": "A businessman owned a hotel, subject to a mortgage securing a debt he owed to a bank. The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?",

The bank was then entitled to foreclose on the businessman's mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. The financing company was a necessary party to that foreclosure proceeding, and was joined in it. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage exceeded the amount due to the financing company, so it is entitled to receive the entire surplus. It makes no difference that the bank's lien on the hotel was entitled to priority over the financing company's lien on the garage. Priority of mortgages is based on the order in which the mortgages were recorded, not on the order in which the properties were acquired by the respective mortgagees. The bank's lien on the hotel was recorded first, but the financing company's lien on the garage was in default, so it is entitled to receive the entire surplus.",

Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor.

The covenant is a contractual agreement between the buyer and the other lot owners. The first buyer's conveyance to the doctor was effective to release the buyer and the doctor from the contractual agreement. The other lot owners are stuck with each other, but the doctor has no obligation to them. The doctor is not a successor to the first buyer, because she did not agree to be bound by the contract. A successor is one who takes title by deed from a grantor without notice of any defects in the title. The doctor is not a successor because she had actual notice of the existence of the restrictive covenant.",

        "question": "A defendant is on trial for attempted fraud. The state charges that the defendant switched a price tag from a cloth coat to a more expensive fur-trimmed coat and then presented the latter for purchase at the cash register. The defendant testified in her own behalf that the tag must have been switched by someone else. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks whether the defendant was convicted on two prior occasions of misdemeanor fraud in the defrauding of a retailer by the same means of switching the price tag on a fur-trimmed coat. Is the question about the convictions for the earlier crimes proper?",
        "answer_a": " Prior convictions of a defendant who takes the stand can be used both to impeach the defendant and to prove that the defendant committed the crime. The defendant's prior convictions for fraud in the defrauding of a retailer by switching the price tag on a fur-trimmed coat are admissible to prove that the defendant committed the crime and to impeach the defendant. They are probative of the defendant's guilt because they involve the same method of fraud as that in the current case. In addition, because the crimes are similar, the jury is likely to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's prior convictions. The fact that the crimes are punishable by the same penalty (a fine and/or imprisonment) is also probative and supports the use of the convictions to impeach the defendant. Finally, the fact that the crimes involve dishonesty is probative and supports the use of the convictions to prove that the defendant committed the crime. Because the probative value of the convictions in proving the crime outweighs the prejudicial effect, their use is proper.",
        "answer_b": "Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), prior bad acts can be admitted to prove the defendant's conduct if offered for some purpose other than to show that the defendant is a bad person. In this case, the bad acts are very similar to the acts in dispute, and tend to show non-character purposes such as intent, knowledge, lack of accident, and modus operandi (i.e., that the defendant has a tendency to engage in particularized activity that sets her apart from others). Thus the bad acts can be offered as proof that the defendant committed the crime charged. Moreover, the convictions are automatically admissible to impeach the defendant's character for truthfulness; fraud convictions clearly involve dishonesty or false statement, and so the court \"shall\" admit the convictions under Rule 609(a)(2).",

Testimony that the witness falsified her medical school transcript is extrinsic evidence that is being offered for the purpose of attacking the witness's character for truthfulness.

        "question": "A customer fell and injured himself when he slipped on a banana peel while shopping at a grocer's store. The banana peel was fresh and clean except for a mark made by the heel of the customer's shoe. In an action brought by the customer against the grocer, these are the only facts in evidence. Should the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?",
        "answer_a": " The customer's claim is that the grocer negligently placed the banana peel on the floor, which caused the customer to slip and fall. The customer's argument is that, since the peel was fresh and clean except for the mark from the customer's shoe, it must have been recently placed there, and thus the grocer was negligent in allowing it to be there. To succeed in his claim, the customer must first show that the grocer had a duty to him. The facts suggest that the grocer was a vendor of bananas, and the customer was a customer. Vendors owe a duty to customers to have their products in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's next argument is that the grocer's knowledge or should-have-known of the banana peel is not relevant to the determination of the grocer's negligence. That is incorrect. A vendor is charged with knowing any unreasonable risks posed by the goods that he or she has offered for sale. A person who offers goods for sale has a duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the goods are in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's final argument is that the grocer could foresee that a customer might slip on a banana peel. That is correct. A person who offers goods for sale may be held liable for any foreseeable injuries caused by those goods. The fact that the banana peel was fresh and clean, except for a mark from the customer's shoe, is a strong indication that the peel was recently placed there, and thus the grocer's failure to detect it was negligent. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect.",
        "answer_b": "Unlike slip-and-fall cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana peel does not indicate that it has been on the ground for any significant period of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer's fall.",

        "question": "The United States Congress enacted a federal statute providing that any state may \"require labeling to show the state or other geographic origin of citrus fruit that is imported into the receiving state.\" Pursuant to the federal statute, a state that produced large quantities of citrus fruit enacted a law requiring all citrus fruit imported into the state to be stamped with a two-letter postal abbreviation signifying the state of the fruit's origin. The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in favor of the state's effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?",

The uncle replied that he would lend the money to the nephew only if the nephew's mother \"guaranteed\" the loan. At the nephew's suggestion, the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother, told her about the loan, and asked if she would \"guarantee\" it. She replied, \"Surely. Lend my son the $4,000 and I'll repay it if he doesn't.\" The uncle then lent $4,000 to the nephew, an amount the nephew orally agreed to repay in six weeks. The next day, the nephew's mother wrote to him and concluded her letter with the words, \"Son, I was happy to do you a favor by promising your uncle I would repay your six-week $4,000 loan if you don't. /s/ Mother.\" Neither the nephew nor his mother repaid the loan when it came due and the uncle sued the mother for breach of contract. In that action, the mother raised the statute of frauds as her only defense. Will the mother's statute-of-frauds defense be successful?",
        "answer_a": " The statute of frauds requires that promises to answer for the debt of another be made in writing. The mother's letter to her son satisfies the requirement of the statute of frauds. The mother's letter is written evidence of her promise to the uncle and is admissible to prove that fact. The memorandum must be addressed to the promisee and must be sufficient to indicate that a promise has been made to the promisee. The mother's letter satisfies that requirement. Thus, answer B is correct.",

But the memorandum sufficient to satisfy the statute needn't be written at the time of the making of the promise, nor need it be a writing addressed to the promisee.

Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. Should the court grant the employee's motion?",
        "answer_a": " A state may grant broader rights under its own constitution than are granted by the federal Constitution. Here, the state has a clear precedent that the recording violated the employee's state constitutional rights and that the recording should be excluded as a remedy. Because the employee's state constitutional rights were violated, the court should grant the employee's motion. Answer A is incorrect because the state may grant broader rights under its own constitution than are granted by the federal Constitution. Answer B is incorrect because it is irrelevant what the police thought about the propriety of their actions under the federal Constitution where the state has granted broader rights under its own constitution, and those rights were violated. Answer D is incorrect because the secret recording of a conversation with a defendant by a government informant, like the recording in this case, is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

In defense, the defendant called a witness to testify, \"I have been the plaintiff's neighbor for many years, and people in our community generally have said that he is a thief.\" Is the testimony concerning the plaintiff's reputation in the community admissible?",
        "answer_a": " Because slander is a false statement claim, one of the most important elements for the plaintiff to prove is that the statement was false. Because of this, character evidence is admissible both to prove that the statement was false (by proving that the person is not a thief) and to prove the damages (by showing that a false statement has a tendency to injure one's reputation). Thus, answer B is correct.",
        "answer_b": "In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects: First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405, when character is \"in issue\" it can be proved by evidence of reputation, opinion, or specific acts.",

This right, however, is limited by the landlord's duty not to interfere with the tenant's use or enjoyment of the property.

At common law, breach of contract was regarded as a wrong against the owner of the promise, and the remedy for such a wrong was considered to be the recovery of damages to compensate the owner for the loss resulting from the breach. In modern law, breach of contract is regarded as a wrong against the injured party, who is entitled to recover damages to compensate him or her for the loss resulting from the breach. The carpenter is entitled to the contract price, which is the amount necessary to put him in the position he would have occupied had the contract been performed.",
        "answer_b": "The carpenter is entitled to the contract price for the work done. The other items of damage are unrecoverable either because they were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made or because they were not caused by the breach. No unjust enrichment claim is viable on these facts, because an unjust enrichment claim cannot exceed the contract price when all of the work giving rise to the claim has been done and the only remaining obligation is the payment of the price. This limitation on unjust enrichment claims was recapitulated in the well known case of Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954), and represents the current rule in such cases.",

        "question": "A plaintiff sued her employer, alleging that poor working conditions had caused her to develop a stomach ulcer. At trial, the plaintiff's medical expert testified to the cause of the plaintiff's ulcer and stated that his opinion was based in part on information in a letter the plaintiff's personal physician had written to the plaintiff's employer, explaining why the plaintiff had missed work. When offered to prove the cause of the plaintiff's condition, is the letter from the plaintiff's doctor admissible?",
        "answer_a": " The doctor's letter is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition was caused by her work environment. The doctor's letter is thus hearsay, and, because it does not meet the requirements of any exception, it is inadmissible.",
        "answer_b": "The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay.",
