The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC.

The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity\nof lumber.\nB. No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and\nrefuse to make any future deliveries.\nC. Yes, because the credit report and audited financial statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under\nthe contract.\nD. Yes, because the supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of financial status\ninformation.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts between the other toy manufacturers and their Green outlets\nwho have agreed to sell their Martian toys.\nB. No, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of toys in Green stores.\nD.

            "explanation": " The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. Protectionism is a policy of protecting domestic producers from foreign competition by imposing restrictions on imports. A protectionist policy is prohibited by the commerce clause. A state law that has a protectionist effect on interstate commerce is invalid. A state law that has an adverse effect on interstate commerce, even if it is not protectionist, is invalid if it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce. The test for determining whether a state law has an adverse effect on interstate commerce is whether it has a substantial effect on the economy of the interstate market. A state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market is invalid if it is not necessary to serve a legitimate state interest. A state law that protects the health or safety of its residents is considered to serve a legitimate state interest. Therefore, a state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market in toys is invalid unless it is necessary to protect the health or safety of the state's residents. Protecting the health and safety of the state's residents justifies any burden on the interstate toy market, so a state law that has a substantial effect on that market is valid if it is designed to protect the health and safety of the state's residents. In this case, the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that the toys it sells satisfy scientific criteria justifies the burden on the interstate toy market. Therefore, the law is constitutional."

A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law.

Here, the oral agreement contradicted the final written agreement by relieving the contractor of its obligation to pave the sidewalk. Therefore, the parol evidence rule bars proof of the prior oral agreement. The fact that the contractor-landowner agreement was oral further supports the conclusion that the agreement was not in good faith; it suggests that the agreement was reached because the landowner wanted the work done and the contractor did not want to do it. For these reasons, answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the contractor-landowner agreement was not a discharge of a contractual obligation; it was an agreement not to enter into a contractual obligation.

The statute was enacted only to expedite the flow of automobile traffic. Due to a sudden and unexpected cold snap, the car owner's waste water formed a puddle that froze. A pedestrian slipped on the frozen puddle and broke her leg. The pedestrian sued the car owner to recover for her injury. At trial, the only evidence the pedestrian offered as to negligence was the car owner's admission that she had violated the statute. At the conclusion of the proofs, both parties moved for a directed verdict. How should the trial judge proceed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because, on the facts, the jury may infer that the car owner was\nnegligent.\nB. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury, because the jury may consider the statutory violation as evidence\nthat the car owner was negligent.\nC.

Students, staff, and faculty convicted by campus tribunals of violating the regulation were made subject to penalties that included fines, suspensions, expulsions, and termination of employment. The regulation was widely unpopular and there was a great deal of public anger directed toward the professors who drafted it. The following year, the state legislature approved a severable provision in the appropriations bill for the university declaring that none of the university's funding could be used to pay the two professors, who were specifically named in the provision. In the past, the professors' salaries had always been paid from funds appropriated to the university by the legislature, and the university had no other funds that could be used to pay them. If the professors challenge the constitutionality of the appropriations provision, is the court likely to uphold the provision?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it amounts to the imposition of a punishment by the legislature without trial.\nB. No, because it was based on conduct the professors engaged in before it was enacted.\nC. Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment gives the state legislature plenary power to appropriate state funds in the\nmanner that it deems most conducive to the welfare of its people.\nD.

Deny both motions, because there is evidence to support a finding that the construction company should have realized\nthat its negligence could create an opportunity for a third party to commit a crime.\nB. Grant the construction company's motion, because no one could have foreseen that the failure to place warning lights\ncould result in the loss of a cargo of valuable goods.\nC. Grant the construction company's motion, because the criminal acts of third persons were a superseding cause of the\nloss.\nD.

Two years later, the debtor purchased land in the county and promptly and properly recorded the warranty deed to it. Subsequently, the debtor borrowed $30,000 from his aunt, signing a promissory note for that amount, which note was secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The aunt failed to make a title search before making the loan. The debtor made no payment to the creditor and defaulted on the mortgage loan from his aunt. A valid judicial foreclosure proceeding was held, in which the creditor, the aunt, and the debtor were named parties. A dispute arose as to which lien has priority. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" A second statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Who has the prior lien?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The aunt, because a judgment lien is subordinate to a mortgage lien.\nB. The aunt, because she is a mortgagee under a purchase money mortgage.\nC. The creditor, because its judgment was filed first.\nD. The creditor, because the aunt had a duty to make a title search of the property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driver's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her and the car, and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat of the car. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding. The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney filed a motion to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin found in the car.

The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage. The neighbor took possession of the land and made several mortgage payments, which the partner accepted. Now, however, neither the neighbor nor the investor has made the last three mortgage payments.

Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the county did not take title to the property from the purchaser.\nB. No, because the regulation has not caused or authorized any uninvited physical invasion or intrusion onto the property.\nC. Yes, because the conservation objective of the county ordinance is not sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial\ndiminution in the property value.\nD. Yes, because the effect of the county's regulation is to deny the purchaser's investment-backed expectation and\nessentially all economically beneficial use of the property.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Deny it as to all photographs.\nB.

The car dealer subsequently sold an automobile to a buyer at a price of $10,000, payable at $1,000 per month beginning on June 1. The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1,000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1, without interest, in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2, the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10,000. In this suit, which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The agreement to extend the time for payment was not in writing.\nB. The car dealer could not delegate its duty to pay to the buyer.\nC. The car dealer gave no consideration for the agreement to extend the time of payment.\nD.

For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The farmer, because he has the right to use all of the water impounded on his land.\nB. The farmer, because the rancher's past impoundment of water estops her from asserting the illegality of the farmer's\ndam.\nC. The rancher, because she has acquired riparian rights to use the water.\nD. The rancher, because the farmer is estopped to claim all of the surface water on his land.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

An owner is entitled to use lateral water, to keep lateral water on his or her land, and to prevent lateral water from leaving his or her land. The farmer's dam prevents the natural flow of lateral water from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. Estoppel is not relevant to determining who owns the water. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the farmer's dam, not the rancher's previous impoundment of water, is the issue in this case. Answer D is incorrect because it is not relevant whether the water is natural or artificial. The farmer's dam, once built, is an artificial obstruction of the watercourse, and the farmer is estopped to claim ownership of the water above the dam. Answer C is correct."

The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance.

The plaintiff alleged that the store negligently allowed its entryway to become slippery due to snow tracked in from the sidewalk. When the plaintiff threatened to sue, the store's manager said, \"I know that there was slush on that marble entry, but I think your four-inch-high heels were the real cause of your fall. So let's agree that we'll pay your medical bills, and you release us from any claims you might have.\" The plaintiff refused the offer. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to testify to the manager's statement that \"there was slush on that marble entry.\" Is the statement about the slush on the floor admissible?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because it is a statement made in the course of compromise negotiations.\nB. No, because the manager denied that the slippery condition was the cause of the plaintiff's fall.\nC. Yes, as an admission by an agent about a matter within the scope of his authority.\nD.

The recorded subdivision plan imposed no restrictions on any of the 10 lots. Within two months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to a buyer, by a deed that contained no restriction on the lot's use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone. Shortly after the landowner's most recent sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1 constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot 1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an appropriate certificate of occupancy to enable her to use a part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner, on behalf of himself as the owner of the unsold lot, and on behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on Lot 1. Who is likely to prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. The doctor, because Lot 1 was conveyed without the inclusion of the restrictive covenant in the deed to the first buyer\nand the subsequent deed to the doctor.\nB. The doctor, because zoning ordinances override private restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\nC. The landowner, because the doctor, as a successor in interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1 remains\nsubject to the zoning ordinance as it existed when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the first buyer.\nD.

Section 2 of the executive order requires all privately owned federally licensed radio and television stations giving weather reports to report temperatures only in Celsius.

            "explanation": " The president has the power to direct the actions of federal executive agencies through executive orders. Actions of federal executive agencies are subject to judicial review, however, so the constitutionality of the order will be determined by a court. There is a rational basis for requiring the Weather Bureau to report temperatures in Celsius, since Celsius is the metric system used by the rest of the world. There is also a rational basis for requiring privately owned, federally licensed radio and television stations to report temperatures in Celsius, since the weather reports are part of the public record and the switch to Celsius would be consistent with the public interest in uniformity. Therefore, Sections 1 and 2 of the executive order are constitutional."

The president, as the chief executive officer of the U.S. government, has authority to direct the actions of federal executive agencies, so long as the president's directives are not inconsistent with an act of Congress.

The contract made no mention of the quality of title to be conveyed. Thereafter, the seller and the investor completed the sale, and the seller delivered a warranty deed to the investor. Soon thereafter, the value of the land increased dramatically. The investor entered into a written contract to sell the land to a buyer. The contract between the investor and the buyer expressly provided that the investor would convey a marketable title. The buyer's attorney discovered that the title to the land was not marketable, and had not been marketable when the original seller conveyed to the investor. The buyer refused to complete the sale. The investor sued the original seller on multiple counts.

In addition, because the crimes are similar, the jury is likely to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's prior convictions. The fact that the crimes are punishable by the same penalty (a fine and/or imprisonment) is also probative and supports the use of the convictions to impeach the defendant.

Larceny is the taking of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of it, without the owner's permission, and without the payment or intending to make any payment for the property. Robbery is the taking of the personal property of another from the other's person by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive the person of it. In this case, the woman took the property of the fast-food restaurant from the clerk by threatening him and by placing him in fear, and she had the intent to permanently deprive the restaurant of the money. The woman's threat was not a part of a plan to commit a further crime because she had no further plan after getting the money. Thus, the woman is guilty of larceny and robbery."

The child, by his representative, sued the driver of the car, the playmate's parents, and his own parents. At trial, the child's total injuries were determined to be $100,000. The playmate's parents were determined to be 20% at fault because they had failed to adequately supervise her. The driver was found to be 50% at fault. The child's own parents were determined to be 30% at fault for failure to adequately supervise him. The court has adopted the pure comparative negligence doctrine, with joint and several liability, in place of the common-law rules relating to plaintiff's fault. In addition, the common-law doctrines relating to intra-family liability have been abrogated.

Therefore, the child's representative can recover the amount of his damages minus 30% ($70,000-$21,000), or $50,000. Answer B is incorrect because the pure comparative negligence rule is followed, and a plaintiff can recover even if he is 99% negligent. Answer D is incorrect because the child is entitled to recover, despite his own negligence.

The National Park Service entered into a contract with an independent antique collector to acquire items owned by residents of the city during the president's lifetime. According to the contract, the collector purchases items and then sells them to the Park Service at a price equal to the collector's cost plus a 10% commission. Purchases by antique collectors are ordinarily subject to the sales tax of the state in which the city is located. The collector files suit in state court to enjoin collection of the tax on these purchases, claiming that the sales tax is unconstitutional as applied to them. Should the state court issue the injunction?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because as the purchaser of these antiques, the collector rather than the federal government is liable for the tax.\nB. No, because the suit is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\nC. Yes, because the federal government is contractually obligated to pay the amount of the sales tax when it covers the\ncollector's cost of these antiques.\nD.

At common law, larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of it, without the owner's permission or consent. Answer A is incorrect because the customer, having no intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the watch, committed common law larceny, and larceny is a more serious offense than robbery. Answer C is incorrect because false pretenses is the incorrect charge to have raised, since no false statement was made; the customer believed his statement to be true. Answer D is incorrect because, although the customer's subsequent threats were done with the intent to intimidate, they were not done with the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the watch, and thus were not larceny."

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review. No standards have yet been adopted. Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization. The brewery is concerned that, after the appropriate proceedings, the Bureau may adopt quality standards that will prohibit the sale of any unpasteurized beer. As a result, the brewery sued in federal district court to enjoin the Bureau from adopting any standards that would prohibit the sale of unpasteurized beer in this country. How should the district court dispose of the suit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Determine whether the Bureau could reasonably believe that pasteurization is the safest process by which to brew\nbeer, and if the Bureau could reasonably believe that, refuse to issue the injunction against the Bureau.\nB.

            "explanation": " The customer's claim is that the grocer negligently placed the banana peel on the floor, which caused the customer to slip and fall. The customer's argument is that, since the peel was fresh and clean except for the mark from the customer's shoe, it must have been recently placed there, and thus the grocer was negligent in allowing it to be there. To succeed in his claim, the customer must first show that the grocer had a duty to him. The facts suggest that the grocer was a vendor of bananas, and the customer was a customer. Vendors owe a duty to customers to have their products in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's next argument is that the grocer's knowledge or should-have-known of the banana peel is not relevant to the determination of the grocer's negligence. That is incorrect. A vendor is charged with knowing any unreasonable risks posed by the goods that he or she has offered for sale. A person who offers goods for sale has a duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the goods are in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's final argument is that the grocer could foresee that a customer might slip on a banana peel. That is correct. A person who offers goods for sale may be held liable for any foreseeable injuries caused by those goods. The fact that the banana peel was fresh and clean, except for a mark from the customer's shoe, is a strong indication that the peel was recently placed there, and thus the grocer's failure to detect it was negligent.

The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in favor of the state's effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Any burden on interstate commerce imposed by the state law is outweighed by a legitimate state interest.\nB. Congress has the authority to authorize specified state regulations that would otherwise be prohibited by the negative\nimplications of the commerce clause, and it has done so in this situation.\nC. The state law does not discriminate against out-of-state citrus growers or producers.\nD. The state law furthers a legitimate state interest, the burden it imposes on interstate commerce is only incidental, and\nthe state's interest cannot be satisfied by other means that are less burdensome to interstate commerce.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. Should the court grant the employee's motion?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the employee's federal constitutional rights were not violated, and this circumstance overrides any state\nconstitutional provisions.\nB. No, because the police were acting in the good-faith belief that their actions were permitted by the federal\nConstitution.\nC.

Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited.

The woman had objected to the district's plans for the stadium and was particularly upset about nighttime athletic events that attracted large crowds and that, at times, resulted in significant noise and light intensity levels. On nights of athletic events, the woman and her family members wore earplugs and could not sleep or enjoy a quiet evening until after 10 p.m. In addition, light from the stadium on those nights was bright enough to allow reading a newspaper in the woman's yard. Which of the following doctrines would best support the woman's claim for damages?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Constructive eviction.\nB. Private nuisance.\nC. Public nuisance.\nD. Waste.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

            "explanation": " A private nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable non-trespassory interference with the use or enjoyment of one's land. The facts indicate that the woman is being exposed to a non-trespassory interference with the use and enjoyment of her land, i.e., the noise and bright lights. Therefore, the woman is entitled to relief for the private nuisance. A public nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable non-trespassory interference with the use or enjoyment of a large number of persons. Since the woman is being exposed to the non-trespassory interference, she may bring a claim for the public nuisance, although the number of people exposed to the nuisance would have to be determined. Waste is the wrong doctrine to apply, because the woman is not being exposed to an excess of waste material on her land. Damages for a private nuisance may be recovered if they are necessary to restore the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. In addition, damages may be recovered for public nuisances."

The buyer was unable to do so, but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller. Will the buyer prevail?\nAnswer Choices:\nA.

The one-year agreement provided for \"daily service at $500 a week.\" From their conversations during negotiation, the laundry company knew that the innkeeper expected laundry services seven days a week. When the laundry company refused to pick up the motel's laundry on two successive Sundays and indicated that it would not ever do so, the innkeeper canceled the agreement. The laundry company sued the innkeeper for breach of contract. At trial, clear evidence was introduced to show that in the commercial laundry business \"daily service\" did not include service on Sundays. Will the laundry company succeed in its action?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the laundry company knew the meaning the innkeeper attached to \"daily service,\" and, therefore, the\ninnkeeper's meaning will control.\nB. No, because the parties attached materially different meanings to \"daily service,\" and, therefore, no contract was\nformed.\nC. Yes, because the parol evidence rule will not permit the innkeeper to prove the meaning she attached to \"daily\nservice.\"\nD. Yes, because the trade usage will control the interpretation of \"daily service.\"\nResponse:\n[/INST]",

In modern law, breach of contract is regarded as a wrong against the injured party, who is entitled to recover damages to compensate him or her for the loss resulting from the breach.

In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay.",
