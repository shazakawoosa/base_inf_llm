In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. $4,000.\nB. $4,200.\nC. $10,000.\nD. $10,200.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "exp1": " When a court finds that a party has breached a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages in accordance with the contract terms. Where the breaching party has committed a total breach of contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that are intended to place the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied but for the breach. In this case, the parties contracted for the teacher to work 10 weeks at the summer camp for $10,000. When the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed, the camp had committed a total breach of contract. Therefore, the teacher should recover damages in the amount of $10,000.",
        "exp2": "The teacher is entitled to be put in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. Application of this principle leads to recovery of the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), PLUS the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 travel expenses). Mitigation expenses can be recovered, if reasonable, even if those particular expenses are not connected to a successful mitigation attempt.",

It also appropriates the entire proceeds of that tax to a special fund, which is required to be used to purchase licenses for computer software that will be made available for use, free of charge, to any resident of the United States. Is this statute constitutional?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. A.No, because the federal government may not impose any direct taxes on citizens of the United States.\nB. No, because this statute takes without just compensation the property of persons who hold patents or copyrights on\ncomputer software.\nC. Yes, because it is a reasonable exercise of the power of Congress to tax and spend for the general welfare.\nD. Yes, because the patent power authorizes Congress to impose reasonable charges on the sale of technology and to\nspend the proceeds of those charges to advance the use of technology in the United States.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "exp1": " Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general welfare. This power is plenary, and it encompasses the power to impose taxes on the sale of goods that are related to the general welfare. Because the proceeds of this tax are devoted to funding the free distribution of computer software, which is related to the advancement of technology in the United States, the tax is constitutional. A is incorrect because the federal government can impose direct taxes on individuals. B is incorrect because it is not taking property to make the licenses available; it is raising the money to pay for the licenses. D is incorrect because the power to patent does not include the power to charge for the use of the patented technology.",
        "exp2": "Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution gives Congress broad power to tax and to spend for the general welfare. Courts defer to reasonable congressional taxing measures, such as the statute at issue in this case, as well as to expenditures that reasonably further the general welfare.",

The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.\nB. No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill.\nC. Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the informant after he had been stabbed.\nD. Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "exp1": " The eight gang members are not guilty of murder. To be criminally liable for the actions of another, a person must have the intent that the actions be committed and aid or abet in the commission of the offense. The gang members did not intend that the informant be murdered; they intended that he be publicly humiliated. Their mere presence at the scene is insufficient to make them accomplices to murder.",
        "exp2": "The eight gang members are not guilty of murder, because they took no affirmative act and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. See generally Wayne R. LaFave, Principles of Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4, at 442-49 (2003).",

The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Both the tenant and the friend are liable for the full $3,500, because the tenant is liable on privity of contract and the\nfriend is liable on privity of estate as assignee.\nB. The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for\n$2,100 on privity of contract and estate for the period after the friend vacated.\nC. The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the tenant is not liable, because the landlord's failure to object to\nthe friend's payment of rent relieved the tenant of liability.\nD. The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and the friend is not liable, because a sublessee does not have\npersonal liability to the original landlord.\nResponse:\n[/INST]",
        "exp1": " An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (the \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. An assignment by a tenant does not discharge the original landlord's lien",
        "exp2": "An assignment arises when a tenant transfers all or some of the leased premises to another for the remainder of the lease term, retaining no interest in the assigned premises. In this case, prior to the agreement with the friend, the tenant had privity of contract with the landlord because of the lease. The tenant also had privity of estate because the tenant was in possession of the apartment. Subsequently, an assignment arose when the tenant transferred the premises to the friend for the remainder of the lease term of nine months. The friend was then in privity of estate with the landlord as to all promises that run with the land, including the covenant to pay rent. The tenant was not released by the landlord, however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract.",

On cross-examination, the defendant asked the witness whether he and Smith were ever wrong. The witness answered, \"Nobody's perfect.\" The defendant asked no further questions. The defendant called a second expert witness and asked, \"Do you accept the Smith book as reliable?\" The second witness said, \"It once was, but it is now badly out of date.\" The plaintiff requested that the jury be allowed to examine the book and judge for itself the book's reliability. Should the court allow the jury to examine the book?\nAnswer Choices:\nA. No, because the jury may consider only passages read to it by counsel or witness.\nB. No, because the plaintiff's expert in testifying did not rely on the treatise but on his own experience.\nC. Yes, because an expert has testified that the treatise is reliable.\nD.
