        "question": "In January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks of service from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period as the summer camp. In a breach-of-contract action against the camp, to which of the following amounts, as damages, is the teacher entitled?",
        "answer_a": " When a court finds that a party has breached a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages in accordance with the contract terms. Where the breaching party has committed a total breach of contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that are intended to place the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied but for the breach. In this case, the parties contracted for the teacher to work 10 weeks at the summer camp for $10,000. When the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed, the camp had committed a total breach of contract. Therefore, the teacher should recover damages in the amount of $10,000.",
        "answer_b": "The teacher is entitled to be put in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. Application of this principle leads to recovery of the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), PLUS the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 travel expenses). Mitigation expenses can be recovered, if reasonable, even if those particular expenses are not connected to a successful mitigation attempt.",
        "comparison_result": "The better explanation is [A/B/C]. \n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation A fails to account for the teacher's mitigation efforts, and the teacher is not entitled to recover the full amount of the contract. In a breach-of-contract action, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that place the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied but for the breach. The teacher's actual damages include the difference between the contract salary and the amount earned at the local summer school, as well as reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach. The teacher's travel expenses to interview at the other nearby summer camp are reasonable and can be recovered, even if the teacher was not successful in securing that position. Therefore, the teacher is entitled to $4,000 (the difference between the contract salary and the amount earned at the local summer school) plus $200 (the travel expenses) for a total of $4,200.\n\nNote: The answer is B. The better explanation is B. Explanation A fails to account for the teacher's mitigation efforts. Explanation B accounts for the teacher's mitigation efforts and provides a clearer understanding of the teacher's damages. Explanation A only provides a general explanation of breach of contract damages, whereas Explanation B provides a more detailed and specific explanation of the teacher's damages. Explanation B also takes into account the teacher's reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach. Therefore, Explanation B is the better explanation. \nThe final answer is B.

        "question": "A federal statute imposes an excise tax of $100 on each new computer sold in the United States. It also appropriates the entire proceeds of that tax to a special fund, which is required to be used to purchase licenses for computer software that will be made available for use, free of charge, to any resident of the United States. Is this statute constitutional?",
        "answer_a": " Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general welfare. This power is plenary, and it encompasses the power to impose taxes on the sale of goods that are related to the general welfare. Because the proceeds of this tax are devoted to funding the free distribution of computer software, which is related to the advancement of technology in the United States, the tax is constitutional. A is incorrect because the federal government can impose direct taxes on individuals. B is incorrect because it is not taking property to make the licenses available; it is raising the money to pay for the licenses. D is incorrect because the power to patent does not include the power to charge for the use of the patented technology.",

        "question": "Nine gang members were indicted for the murder of a tenth gang member who had become an informant. The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?",
        "answer_a": " The eight gang members are not guilty of murder. To be criminally liable for the actions of another, a person must have the intent that the actions be committed and aid or abet in the commission of the offense. The gang members did not intend that the informant be murdered; they intended that he be publicly humiliated. Their mere presence at the scene is insufficient to make them accomplices to murder.",

        "question": "A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant by written lease for two years ending on the last day of a recent month. The lease provided for $700 monthly rental. The tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15 months of the lease term, until he moved to a new job in another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved a friend into the apartment and signed an informal writing transferring to the friend his \"lease rights\" for the remaining nine months of the lease. The friend made the next four monthly $700 rental payments to the landlord. For the final five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and the friend moved out with three months left of the lease term. The landlord was on an extended trip abroad, and did not learn of the default and the vacancy until last week. The landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally, for $3,500 for the last five months' rent. What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?",
        "answer_a": " An assignment of a lease by a tenant occurs where the tenant transfers all his rights and duties under a lease to another party (the \"assignee\") for the entire length of time remaining on the lease. An assignment by a tenant does not discharge the original landlord's lien",
        "answer_b": "An assignment arises when a tenant transfers all or some of the leased premises to another for the remainder of the lease term, retaining no interest in the assigned premises. In this case, prior to the agreement with the friend, the tenant had privity of contract with the landlord because of the lease. The tenant also had privity of estate because the tenant was in possession of the apartment. Subsequently, an assignment arose when the tenant transferred the premises to the friend for the remainder of the lease term of nine months. The friend was then in privity of estate with the landlord as to all promises that run with the land, including the covenant to pay rent. The tenant was not released by the landlord, however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract.",

On cross-examination, the defendant asked the witness whether he and Smith were ever wrong. The witness answered, \"Nobody's perfect.\" The defendant asked no further questions.

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier wrote the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed its latest audited financial statements to the supplier, as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer sued the lumber supplier for breach of contract. Will the manufacturer prevail?",

It accurately depicts the Martian landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it. The toy is of high quality, safe, durable, and has sold very well. Other toy manufacturers, all located outside Green, developed similar toys that are lower in price. These manufacturers have contracts to sell their Martian toys to outlets in Green. Although these toys are safe and durable, they depict the Martian landscape less realistically than the toys manufactured in Green. Nevertheless, because of the price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the sales of the Martian toys manufactured in Green. The Green legislature subsequently enacted a law \"to protect the children of Green from faulty science and to protect Green toy manufacturers from unfair competition.\" This law forbids the sale in Green of any toy that purports to represent extraterrestrial objects and does not satisfy specified scientific criteria. The Martian toy manufactured in Green satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the competing manufacturers meets the requirements. Is the Green law constitutional?",
        "answer_a": " The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. Protectionism is a policy of protecting domestic producers from foreign competition by imposing restrictions on imports. A protectionist policy is prohibited by the commerce clause. A state law that has a protectionist effect on interstate commerce is invalid. A state law that has an adverse effect on interstate commerce, even if it is not protectionist, is invalid if it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce. The test for determining whether a state law has an adverse effect on interstate commerce is whether it has a substantial effect on the economy of the interstate market. A state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market is invalid if it is not necessary to serve a legitimate state interest. A state law that protects the health or safety of its residents is considered to serve a legitimate state interest. Therefore, a state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market in toys is invalid unless it is necessary to protect the health or safety of the state's residents. Protecting the health and safety of the state's residents justifies any burden on the interstate toy market, so a state law that has a substantial effect on that market is valid if it is designed to protect the health and safety of the state's residents. In this case, the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that the toys it sells satisfy scientific criteria justifies the burden on the interstate toy market. Therefore, the law is constitutional.",

Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law. The state law therefore violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.",

It claims that the law is protectionist and violates the negative implications of the commerce clause because it has a purely discriminatory effect against out-of-state manufacturers.\n\n## Step 3: Compare the coherence and evidence of both explanations\nExplanation A relies on the idea that the law is necessary to protect the health and safety of the state's residents, but it does not provide clear evidence that the law is actually necessary to achieve this goal. Explanation B, on the other hand, provides a clear and concise argument that the law is protectionist and discriminates against out-of-state manufacturers, which is supported by the negative implications of the commerce clause.\n\n## Step 4: Determine which explanation is more convincing\nExplanation B's argument is more convincing because it clearly and concisely explains why the Green law is unconstitutional. It provides a clear analysis of the law's effect on interstate commerce and demonstrates that the law is protectionist and discriminatory.\n\n## Step 5: Choose the better explanation\nBased on the comparison of the two explanations, Explanation B is the better choice.\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an explanation for the answer choice.).\n\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an explanation for the answer choice.).\n\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an explanation for the answer choice.).\n\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an explanation for the answer choice.).\n\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an explanation for the answer choice.).\n\n\nThe final answer is: [B]  (Note: I will not be able to provide an",

        "question": "A landowner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey his land to a friend. The landowner handed the instrument to the friend, saying, \"This is yours, but please do not record it until after I am dead. Otherwise, it will cause me no end of trouble with my relatives.\" Two days later, the landowner asked the friend to return the deed to him because he had decided that he should devise the land to the friend by will rather than by deed. The friend said that he would destroy the deed and a day or so later falsely told the landowner that the deed had been destroyed. Six months ago, the landowner, who had never executed a will, died intestate, survived by a daughter as his sole heir at law. The day after the landowner's death, the friend recorded the deed from him. As soon as the daughter discovered this recording and the friend's claim to the land, she brought an appropriate action against the friend to quiet title to the land. For whom should the court hold?",
        "answer_a": " A gift of land requires no consideration and needs no execution; it is sufficient if the gift is made while the donor has the title",
        "answer_b": "A deed must be delivered to be valid. Delivery is a question of intent. The words of the landowner included \"this is yours,\" showing the necessary intent to strip himself of dominion and control over the deed and to immediately transfer the title. In addition, handing the deed to the grantee raises a rebuttable presumption of delivery. Recording the deed is not required and thus the request not to record the document until later is irrelevant so long as delivery was present.",

It only mentions that a gift of land requires no consideration and needs no execution, but it does not explain how these principles apply to the facts of the case. It does not address the landowner's request not to record the deed, the friend's subsequent return of the deed, or the friend's subsequent recording of the deed after the landowner's death. Therefore, Explanation A is not a complete answer to the question.\n\nExplanation B, on the other hand, addresses the key issue of the question directly.

It provides evidence for the landowner's intent to deliver the deed, including his words (\"this is yours\") and the fact that he handed the deed to the friend. It also addresses the landowner's request not to record the deed, explaining that recording is not required for delivery. Finally, it addresses the friend's subsequent actions, explaining that the friend's return of the deed does not negate the delivery that occurred when the landowner handed the deed to the friend.

The drug dealer said that he needed time to get the cocaine. They agreed to meet again in 10 days. An hour later, without a warrant, other officers forcibly entered the drug dealer's apartment and arrested him for attempted possession of a controlled substance. If the drug dealer is prosecuted in a common-law jurisdiction for attempted possession of cocaine, should he be convicted?",
        "answer_a": " The common law of attempt requires that the defendant have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the crime, and that the step have a natural tendency to bring about the commission of the crime. The drug dealer's agreement to sell the cocaine, even if sincere, was not a substantial step because it was part of an ongoing negotiation that was to continue for 10 days and it was not a step that had any natural tendency to bring about the commission of the crime. In modern statutory jurisdictions, however, attempt requires only that the defendant have the intent to commit the crime and that the defendant take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. So, Answer A is correct in a statutory jurisdiction.",
        "answer_b": "The common law of attempt required that the defendant commit some act (beyond mere \"preparation\") toward bringing about the intended crime. Wayne R. LaFave, Principles of Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4, at 442-49 (2003). Here, the drug dealer took no act, much less any act that would qualify at common law, toward obtaining the cocaine. See, e.g., People v. Warren, 489 N.E.2d 240 (N.Y. 1985) (finding no common law attempt on much stronger facts for prosecution than this fact pattern). Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no \"substantial step\" toward commission of the crime.

The patient's father, immediately after having been told of his son's suicide, suffered severe emotional distress, which resulted in a stroke. The patient's father was not present at his son's appointment with the psychiatrist and did not witness the suicide. The father brought an action against the psychiatrist to recover for his severe emotional distress and the resulting stroke. Will the father prevail?",
        "answer_a": " The psychiatrist's duty of care was to the patient, not to the father. The patient was the one who was undergoing the evaluation, and it was the patient whose condition was being misdiagnosed.

On cross-examination, the defendant's lawyer asked whether the plaintiff claimed that he was exercising due care at the time, and the plaintiff replied that he was driving carefully. At a sidebar conference, the defendant's lawyer sought permission to ask the plaintiff about two prior intersection accidents in the last 12 months where he received traffic citations for failing to stop at stop signs. The plaintiff's lawyer objected. Should the court allow defense counsel to ask the plaintiff about the two prior incidents?",
        "answer_a": " Under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), a witness is permitted to impeach himself. However, the evidence must be relevant to a material issue in the case. The incident's bearing on the plaintiff's veracity is tenuous at best. Moreover, the incident's contradiction to the plaintiff's testimony is also tenuous. A prior inconsistent statement is not admissible to impeach a witness unless it is given under oath and under penalty of perjury. Because the prior incidents were not under oath, they are inadmissible. Thus, answer A is correct.",

As a general matter, a witness also can be impeached with evidence that contradicts a part of his testimony that bears on an important issue in dispute. However, in this case, the prior bad acts do not contradict the witness's testimony that he stopped on this occasion. Essentially, the defendant is trying to show that the plaintiff is a careless driver.

For example, it distinguishes between the \"best evidence\" rule (Rule 1003) and the \"former testimony\" rule (Rule 608(a)), and explains that neither is relevant because the prosecutor is not trying to prove what the transcript says, but rather what the defendant said. It also explains why the \"past recollection recorded\" rule (Rule 1004) is not relevant, and provides an example of when it would be relevant. This level of analysis is absent in Explanation B.

        "question": "A state legislature passed a statute providing that juries in criminal trials were to consist of 6 rather than 12 jurors, and providing that jury verdicts did not have to be unanimous but could be based on 5 votes out of 6 jurors. A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1 and, over the defendant's objection, the court entered a judgment of conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the state supreme court. The defendant seeks to overturn his conviction in a habeas corpus action in federal court, claiming his constitutional rights were violated by allowing a jury verdict that was not unanimous and by allowing a jury composed of fewer than 12 members. How is the federal court likely to rule in this action?",
        "answer_a": " The Constitution does not require a unanimous jury verdict where the state has a jury verdict law that allows a less than unanimous verdict. Here, the state has such a law, and the federal court will uphold the conviction. The Constitution does not require a jury composed of more than 12 members, either. Here, the jury was composed of six members, and while the defendant argues that this violates his constitutional rights, there is no precedent to support his claim.

The granting clause of the instrument ran to the church \"and its successors forever, so long as the premises are used for church purposes.\" The church took possession of the land and used it as its site of worship for many years. Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a valid written contract to sell the land to a buyer for a substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site for business activities and objected to the church's title. The contract contained no provision relating to the quality of title the church was bound to convey. There is no applicable statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the buyer for specific performance and properly joined the grantor as a party. Is the church likely to prevail?",

A reversion is a future interest that automatically becomes possessory upon the occurrence of the limitation.  A possibility of reverter is a future interest that automatically becomes possessory only if the grantee does something that would trigger the limitation.  The limitation in this case is that the land must be used for church purposes.

The prior inconsistent statement was not made under oath, so it may be used only to impeach the witness's credibility as a witness.

The statute was enacted only to expedite the flow of automobile traffic. Due to a sudden and unexpected cold snap, the car owner's waste water formed a puddle that froze. A pedestrian slipped on the frozen puddle and broke her leg. The pedestrian sued the car owner to recover for her injury. At trial, the only evidence the pedestrian offered as to negligence was the car owner's admission that she had violated the statute. At the conclusion of the proofs, both parties moved for a directed verdict. How should the trial judge proceed?",
        "answer_a": " The pedestrian's claim is that the car owner was negligent in causing the puddle to form. The pedestrian's claim is not that the car owner violated the statute; rather, it is that the car owner was negligent in the way she handled the water. The pedestrian's claim is that the car owner should have used sand to deice the area or should have waited until later in the day to wash her car. Because the pedestrian's claim is that the car owner was negligent, the court should deny both motions and submit the case to the jury. The jury can, but is not required to, draw the inference that the car owner was negligent from the fact that she violated the statute.

The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the police decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The police asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table.

The child testified while she was seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant. The defendant appealed to the state supreme court claiming that the inability of the witness to see the defendant while she testified violated both the United States Constitution and the state constitution.

The speaker was late, and the wife stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. While there, she saw a man placing what she believed to be a bomb against a wall at the back of the building. She went back inside and told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded, killing eight persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence. As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit?",

In contrast, Explanation B provides a clear and concise argument that the wife did not have a legal duty to warn others about the bomb, citing a reputable legal source, Wayne R.

LaFave, Principles of Criminal Law \u00a7 5.2, at 213-17 (2003).  The key here is the concept of legal duty. In criminal law, a person is only guilty of a crime if they have a legal duty to act in a certain way. In this case, the wife did not have a legal duty to warn others about the bomb because she was not in a position of authority or responsibility over the event or the people who were there. She was simply a spectator, and there was no law or regulation that required her to report her suspicions. Therefore, she cannot be held criminally liable for failing to warn others about the bomb. The fact that she took action and left the scene with her husband and son does not change the fact that she did not have a legal duty to warn others. This is an important distinction because it highlights the difference between a moral obligation and a legal duty. While the wife may have had a moral obligation to warn others about the bomb, she did not have a legal duty to do so.

        "answer_a": " An action for assault is defined at common law as the unlawful application of force to the person of another that causes the other to apprehend an imminent contact with force. The threat of force, even if unaccompanied by any force, is sufficient for the establishment of a cause of action for assault. The question indicates that the ammunition for the revolver was stored in a locked basement closet. Because the guest knew the ammunition was stored in the basement, the guest will prevail, because the guest was put in apprehension of an imminent contact with force - the threat that the host would be able to obtain the ammunition and use it on the guest.",

        "answer_a": " The wife has a privilege not to testify against her husband in a criminal case. That privilege, however, does not apply in this case because the testimony is not being offered against the defendant to impeach his wife. It is being offered to establish the identity of the robber. Because the testimony is relevant and important to the case, the wife's viewing of the defendant's clothing was not a confidential communication, and the interspousal privilege does not apply.

        "question": "At the defendant's trial for a gang-related murder, the prosecution introduced, as former testimony, a statement by a gang member who testified against the defendant at a preliminary hearing and has now invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. If the defendant now seeks to impeach the credibility of the gang member, which of the following is the court most likely to admit?",
        "answer_a": " This is one of the few instances where prior bad acts can be used to impeach a witness. Evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by the witness can be used to impeach his current testimony if it is given under oath and subject to cross-examination. Because the gang member's prior testimony is inconsistent with his present assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony is impeachable. The gang member's prior inconsistent statement can be used to impeach his current testimony. The court is likely to admit testimony by a witness that the gang member is challenging the defendant's leadership role in the gang because this is inconsistent with his earlier testimony and is thus impeachable.",
        "answer_b": "This is evidence of \"bias.\" It shows that the declarant had a motive to implicate the defendant falsely, because by doing so he would remove the defendant from the position that he wanted to have. Evidence of bias is considered important and, generally speaking, it is liberally admitted. Note that the gang member can be impeached even though he is not at trial to testify. Federal Rule of Evidence 806 allows parties to impeach a hearsay declarant in the same ways that would be permitted if the declarant were to testify. This is because a hearsay declarant is essentially a witness in the case.",

The defendant is on trial for a serious crime, and the prosecution is using the gang member's testimony to establish the defendant's guilt. The gang member's credibility is crucial in this case, and the defendant seeks to impeach his testimony to challenge the prosecution's case. The court must balance the need to ensure a fair trial with the need to protect the witness's privilege against self-incrimination.

The motion to suppress should be granted because there was no arrest for the traffic violation and no lawful arrest could be made on the basis of the warrant. A warrant is required for a search if the driver is arrested for the traffic violation, or if the police have probable cause to believe drugs are in the car. In this case, neither circumstance existed. The fact that the computer listed the warrant as outstanding was irrelevant; the warrant was quashed 10 days earlier and the clerk of the court had not updated the computer. Because there was no lawful arrest or valid warrant, the driver was unconstitutionally searched, and the evidence should be suppressed.",
        "answer_b": "Evidence generally will not be suppressed where police reasonably held a good faith belief that their actions leading to its discovery were authorized by a valid warrant. See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995) (good faith exception to exclusionary rule applied where arrest and resulting incidental search were based on warrant that was quashed 17 days earlier but, due to court employees' clerical error, still showed up in computer database). In this case, the computer check on the license number of the driver's car revealed that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver's arrest based on unpaid parking tickets. The police had no reason to believe that the warrant was invalid, so the search of the car was proper.",
        "comparison_result": "[Answer]\n[B]  The motion to suppress should be denied. The police reasonably believed that the warrant was outstanding and was, therefore, a lawful basis for the search and seizure. Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995)  The fact that the warrant had been quashed 10 days earlier was irrelevant. The exclusionary rule does not require the police to verify the validity of a warrant in every case. See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984). A good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies where the police reasonably believe that their actions were authorized by a valid warrant, even if the warrant is later found to be defective. In this case, the police acted in good faith, relying on the information provided by the computer database, and the search and seizure were lawful. Therefore, the motion to suppress should be denied.  [Note: This is the correct answer] \n\nExplanation A's reasoning is based on the idea that the warrant was quashed and therefore was not valid. However, this explanation ignores the fact that the police had no reason to know that the warrant was quashed. The police relied on the information provided by the computer database, and they had no reason to believe that the information was incorrect. Therefore, this explanation is not supported by the facts.\n\nExplanation B's reasoning is based on the idea that the police acted in good faith and relied on the information provided by the computer database.

        "question": "An investor purchased a tract of land, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from a business partner that was secured by a mortgage. The investor made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly for several years. Then the investor persuaded a neighbor to buy the land, subject to the mortgage to his partner. They expressly agreed that the neighbor would not assume and agree to pay the investor's debt to the partner. The investor's mortgage to the partner contained a due-on-sale clause stating, \"If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable.\" However, without seeking his partner's consent, the investor conveyed the land to the neighbor, the deed stating in pertinent part \" . . . , subject to a mortgage to [the partner],\" and giving details and recording data related to the mortgage.

        "question": "A purchaser bought land in the mountain foothills just outside a resort town and planned to build a housing development there. Soon thereafter, the county in which the land was located unexpectedly adopted a regulation that, for the first time, prohibited all construction in several foothill and mountain areas, including the area of the purchaser's property. The purpose of the county's regulation was \"to conserve for future generations the unique natural wildlife and plant habitats\" in the mountain areas. Since the adoption of the regulation, the purchaser has been unable to lease or sell the property at any price. Several realtors have advised the purchaser that the property is now worthless. The purchaser sued the county, claiming that the regulation has taken the purchaser's property and that the county therefore owes the purchaser just compensation. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the purchaser?",

Here, the county's regulation has had that effect, and so it has taken the purchaser's property, for which the county must pay just compensation. A is incorrect because title to the property was not taken by the county.

Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child.

The defendant is charged with multiple counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer.

Several months later, after a thorough investigation, the allegations were proven false and the professor was granted tenure. He had remained working at the medical school at full pay during the tenure decision review process and thus suffered no pecuniary harm. In a suit for libel by the professor against the dean of the medical school, will the professor prevail?",
        "answer_a": " The professor will not prevail, because he invited the dean to make the statement. An author may be held liable for the false statements contained in a work if the author knew or had reason to know that the work contained false statements and if the author was motivated by a desire to harm the plaintiff.

This explanation implies that the professor's inaction led to the dean's inquiry, which resulted in the alleged libelous statement.

Furthermore, this explanation does not explicitly address the issue of the dean's reasonable belief that the professor invited him to speak. \n\nExplanation B, on the other hand, presents a clearer and more coherent argument. It explicitly states that the professor can establish a prima facie case of defamation, which is a necessary step in any defamation claim. However, it also acknowledges that the dean has a valid defense based on his reasonable belief that the professor invited him to speak.

        "question": "A man bought an antique car from a car dealer in State A. Under State A law, a person who buys from such a dealer acquires good title, even if the property was stolen from a previous owner. The man showed the car at an antique car show in State B. A woman recognized the car as having been stolen from her. Under State B law, a person whose property is stolen may reclaim it, even if the current possessor is an innocent purchaser. The woman sued the man in a State B court to reclaim the car. The man defended, claiming that he had good title under the law of State A. Nevertheless, the State B court applied State B law, and the woman prevailed. The man did not appeal. The sheriff gave the woman possession of the car. Several months later, the woman drove the car to State A. The man brought a new suit against the woman, claiming that the State B court in the prior suit should have applied the State A law, which protected innocent purchasers. The woman appeared and moved to dismiss the suit. What should the State A court do?",
        "answer_a": " Full faith and credit shall be given to judgments of the courts of one state by the courts of every other state. Because the woman prevailed in the prior suit, the State B court must give full faith and credit to the State B judgment. Accordingly, it would be improper for the State A court to apply the State A law in this suit. Instead, the State A court should dismiss the suit.",

        "question": "A rancher and a farmer own adjacent tracts of rural land. For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded on her land the water that resulted from rain and melting snow, much of which flowed from the farmer's land. The rancher uses the water in her livestock operation. Recently, the farmer increased the size of his farming operation and built a dam on his land near the boundary between the two tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. There is no applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him from interfering with the natural flow of the water onto her land. Who is likely to prevail?",
        "answer_a": " A watercourse, whether natural or artificial, is considered to be lateral, or lateral, water. Lateral water belongs to the owner of the land through which it flows. An owner is entitled to use lateral water, to keep lateral water on his or her land, and to prevent lateral water from leaving his or her land. The farmer's dam prevents the natural flow of lateral water from the farmer's land onto the rancher's land. Estoppel is not relevant to determining who owns the water. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the farmer's dam, not the rancher's previous impoundment of water, is the issue in this case. Answer D is incorrect because it is not relevant whether the water is natural or artificial. The farmer's dam, once built, is an artificial obstruction of the watercourse, and the farmer is estopped to claim ownership of the water above the dam. Answer C is correct.",

        "answer_a": " Damages may be recovered for physical injuries caused by defective products, and damages may also be recovered for injuries caused by professional malpractice. In this case, the patient is likely to recover on both theories. The dentist's use of a defective needle was a proximate cause of the patient's injuries, and the dentist's failure to detect the defect would not constitute a defense to a strict products liability claim. Likewise, the patient's injury was a foreseeable consequence of the dentist's actions, and thus his malpractice is another basis upon which damages may be recovered. Thus, Answer D is correct.",
        "answer_b": "The strict products liability suit would fail because the dentist was not in the business of selling the product, and the malpractice suit would fail because the plaintiff could not establish that the defendant departed from the professional standard of care.",

A week after the bottles were delivered, the bottling company received the wholesaler's acknowledgement form, which included a provision disclaiming consequential damages. After using the bottles for two months, the bottling company discovered a defect in the bottles that caused its products to leak from them. The bottling company recalled 10,000 of the bottles containing its product, incurring lost profits of $40,000. Assuming all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the bottling company succeed in recovering $40,000 in consequential damages from the wholesaler?",
        "answer_a": " The UCC defines an acceptance as a manifestation of agreement to a contract by a party against whom the offer is directed. An acceptance is effective upon dispatch if a mailed acceptance is a dispatch. The terms of the contract between the wholesaler and the bottling company arose from their course of dealing, the parties' tacit agreements, and the terms of the wholesaler's acknowledgement form. The bottling company's purchase order was an offer to enter into such a contract. The wholesaler's shipment of the bottles was an acceptance of the offer and formation of the contract. The terms of the contract included the disclaimer of consequential damages. The bottling company's subsequent use of the bottles and its incurrence of losses are relevant to the determination of whether the bottling company has breached the contract. However, the bottling company's breach is irrelevant because the contract's liquidated damages clause (in the form of the disclaimer) provides for the recovery of the loss the wholesaler incurred due to the bottling company's breach. The bottling company is not entitled to recover consequential damages because the contract did not permit such damages, and the contract's liquidated damages clause is enforceable.",

        "question": "A state statute defines murder in the first degree as \"knowingly causing the death of another person after deliberation upon the matter.\" Second-degree murder is defined as \"knowingly causing the death of another person.\" Manslaughter is defined as at common law. Deliberation is defined as \"cool reflection for any length of time, no matter how brief.\" The defendant, despondent and angry over losing his job, was contemplating suicide. He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated. A customer on the next stool was telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize and become more efficient in order to keep the economy strong. The defendant turned to him and said, \"Why don't you shut the hell up.\" The customer responded, \"This is a free country and I can say what I want,\" all the while shaking his finger at the defendant. The finger-shaking, combined with his already bad disposition and the alcohol, enraged the defendant. Trembling with fury, he snatched his revolver from his pocket and shot and killed the customer. What crime did the defendant commit?",
        "answer_a": " The defendant's intoxication did not preclude the mens rea required for second-degree murder. It is generally held that intoxication cannot further reduce the homicide from second degree to manslaughter. The defendant committed second degree murder because he knowingly caused the customer's death.",

LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 9.5(b) (2d ed. 2003) (it is \"generally held\" that \"intoxication cannot further reduce the homicide from second degree murder down to manslaughter\").",

His intoxication did not preclude the mens rea required for second-degree murder. It is generally held that intoxication cannot further reduce the homicide from second-degree murder to manslaughter. The defendant's actions were reckless and he showed a disregard for human life. His actions also demonstrate a lack of care for the consequences of his actions, which is a characteristic of a second-degree murder. Therefore, the defendant's actions meet the definition of second-degree murder. The defendant's actions were not manslaughter because manslaughter is defined as killing at common law, and the facts do not indicate that the defendant killed in the heat of passion or in the commission of a felony. The defendant's actions were also not first-degree murder because they do not meet the requirement of deliberation. The defendant did not have time to coolly reflect on his actions before committing the crime, and he was not able to form the requisite intent for first-degree murder. Therefore, the defendant committed second-degree murder.  Answer option D is incorrect because the defendant did not commit first-degree murder. The defendant did not have the requisite deliberation for first-degree murder, and his actions do not meet the definition of first-degree murder. Answer option C is incorrect because the defendant did not commit manslaughter. The defendant's actions do not meet the definition of manslaughter, and he did not kill in the heat of passion or in the commission of a felony. The correct answer is B.

Such a procedure must allow a court to approve an abortion for a minor without parental notification if the court finds: (1) the minor is sufficiently mature and informed to make an independent decision to obtain an abortion; or (2) the abortion would be in the minor's best interest.

        "question": "A businessman owned a hotel, subject to a mortgage securing a debt he owed to a bank. The businessman later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from a financing company, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the businessman defaulted on the loan owed to the bank, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. The financing company was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds of the sale of the hotel to a third party were $200,000 less than the bank's mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage to a fourth party were $200,000 more than the financing company's mortgage balance. How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the parking garage be distributed?",
        "answer_a": " The foreclosure sale of the bank's mortgage on the hotel was insufficient to pay the businessman's debt to the bank. The bank was then entitled to foreclose on the businessman's mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. The financing company was a necessary party to that foreclosure proceeding, and was joined in it. The net proceeds of the sale of the parking garage exceeded the amount due to the financing company, so it is entitled to receive the entire surplus. It makes no difference that the bank's lien on the hotel was entitled to priority over the financing company's lien on the garage. Priority of mortgages is based on the order in which the mortgages were recorded, not on the order in which the properties were acquired by the respective mortgagees. The bank's lien on the hotel was recorded first, but the financing company's lien on the garage was in default, so it is entitled to receive the entire surplus.",
        "answer_b": "The foreclosure sale of the bank's mortgage on the hotel was insufficient to pay the businessman's debt to the bank. The bank had received a judgment against the businessman for the entire amount of the defaulted loan. This lien was properly recorded and applied to all property owned by the businessman during the ten-year time period, including the parking garage. (The bank may have decided on this course of action because it deemed the businessman's equity in the garage was significant and the timing was bad for a hotel foreclosure.) After the financing company was paid in full from the funds generated by the foreclosure sale of its mortgage on the parking garage, the additional funds generated by that sale would be paid to the bank not as a deficiency judgment, but because of the unsatisfied amount of the prior money judgment.",

Since the manager's statement was made in an effort to settle the dispute, the entire statement is protected under Rule 408.\n\nExplanation A is better because it acknowledges the distinction between compromise negotiations and the statement about the cause of the fall. Explanation A recognizes that the manager's statement was made in the context of a settlement negotiation but argues that the statement about the slush on the floor is admissible because it is a comment on the cause of the fall, not a compromise negotiation. This shows a better understanding of Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and its application to the facts of the case.

        "question": "In a civil action, the plaintiff sued a decedent's estate to recover damages for the injuries she suffered in a collision between her car and one driven by the decedent. At trial, the plaintiff introduced undisputed evidence that the decedent's car swerved across the median of the highway, where it collided with an oncoming car driven by the plaintiff. The decedent's estate introduced undisputed evidence that, prior to the car's crossing the median, the decedent suffered a fatal heart attack, which she had no reason to foresee, and that, prior to the heart attack, the decedent had been driving at a reasonable speed and in a reasonable manner. A statute makes it a traffic offense to cross the median of a highway. In this case, for whom should the court render judgment?",
        "answer_a": " The burden of proof is on the party asserting negligence, in this case the plaintiff. To establish negligence, the plaintiff must establish that the decedent's conduct was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. A proximate cause is a cause that is foreseeable from the perspective of a reasonable person. A defendant will be held liable for the foreseeable consequences of her actions. In this case, the facts suggest that the decedent's death was an unforeseeable event. A reasonable person would not have foreseen that a heart attack would occur, and thus the defendant should not be held liable for her death. Answer C is correct.",
        "answer_b": "The plaintiff's evidence that the decedent violated the statute and crossed over into her lane of traffic does establish a prima facie case of negligence. However, the decedent's estate successfully rebutted the plaintiff's evidence by providing an undisputed explanation of how the accident happened that is inconsistent with a finding of negligence (the decedent's unforeseeable heart attack made her unable to comply with the statute, or indeed with any standard of care).",

It explains that a proximate cause is a cause that is foreseeable from the perspective of a reasonable person. This reasoning is clear and directly addresses the question. Explanation A also provides a specific example to support its claim, stating that a reasonable person would not have foreseen a heart attack occurring. This makes the explanation more convincing and easier to understand.\n\nExplanation B, on the other hand, focuses on the rebuttal of the plaintiff's evidence by the defendant's estate. While it mentions the plaintiff's prima facie case of negligence, it does not delve into the specifics of proximate cause and foreseeability. Instead, it relies on a general statement that the defendant's estate provided an undisputed explanation of how the accident happened. This explanation lacks depth and clarity compared to Explanation A.\n\nIn conclusion, Explanation A is more effective in addressing the question because it provides clear reasoning, specific examples, and a deeper understanding of the concept of proximate cause.

Two years later, the real estate market in the state had generally improved and, during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of conveyance, the landowner included the following language: \"It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the 10 lots [with an appropriate reference to the recorded subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording of the plan, no use shall be made of the premises herein conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.\" The buyer of Lot 1 had actual knowledge of what the landowner had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part because the zoning ordinance of the municipality had been amended a year earlier to permit professional offices in any residential zone.

In performing each contract, the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and, upon delivery, the buyer signed an invoice that showed an agreed upon price for that delivery. Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller, the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used in the present contract as had been used previously. The present contract called for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300,000. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice.

In this case, the parties' course of dealing falls within UCC \u00a7 2-202(3) because they have dealt with each other in hundreds of separate contracts and the contracts are silent with respect to the time and place of payment as well as the discount for prompt payment.

        "question": "A defendant is on trial for attempted fraud. The state charges that the defendant switched a price tag from a cloth coat to a more expensive fur-trimmed coat and then presented the latter for purchase at the cash register. The defendant testified in her own behalf that the tag must have been switched by someone else. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks whether the defendant was convicted on two prior occasions of misdemeanor fraud in the defrauding of a retailer by the same means of switching the price tag on a fur-trimmed coat. Is the question about the convictions for the earlier crimes proper?",
        "answer_a": " Prior convictions of a defendant who takes the stand can be used both to impeach the defendant and to prove that the defendant committed the crime. The defendant's prior convictions for fraud in the defrauding of a retailer by switching the price tag on a fur-trimmed coat are admissible to prove that the defendant committed the crime and to impeach the defendant. They are probative of the defendant's guilt because they involve the same method of fraud as that in the current case. In addition, because the crimes are similar, the jury is likely to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's prior convictions. The fact that the crimes are punishable by the same penalty (a fine and/or imprisonment) is also probative and supports the use of the convictions to impeach the defendant. Finally, the fact that the crimes involve dishonesty is probative and supports the use of the convictions to prove that the defendant committed the crime. Because the probative value of the convictions in proving the crime outweighs the prejudicial effect, their use is proper.",
        "answer_b": "Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), prior bad acts can be admitted to prove the defendant's conduct if offered for some purpose other than to show that the defendant is a bad person. In this case, the bad acts are very similar to the acts in dispute, and tend to show non-character purposes such as intent, knowledge, lack of accident, and modus operandi (i.e., that the defendant has a tendency to engage in particularized activity that sets her apart from others). Thus the bad acts can be offered as proof that the defendant committed the crime charged. Moreover, the convictions are automatically admissible to impeach the defendant's character for truthfulness; fraud convictions clearly involve dishonesty or false statement, and so the court \"shall\" admit the convictions under Rule 609(a)(2).",

The child's own parents were determined to be 30% at fault for failure to adequately supervise him. The court has adopted the pure comparative negligence doctrine, with joint and several liability, in place of the common-law rules relating to plaintiff's fault.

Answer B is incorrect because the pure comparative negligence rule is followed, and a plaintiff can recover even if he is 99% negligent.

        "question": "A homeowner owned a large poisonous snake which had been defanged and was kept in a cage. A storm damaged the homeowner's house and the snake's cage, allowing it to escape. During the cleanup after the storm, a volunteer worker came across the snake. The worker tried to run away from the snake and fell, breaking his arm. In a suit by the worker against the homeowner based on strict liability in tort to recover for his injury, will the worker prevail?",
        "answer_a": " A strict liability claim can be based on the mere presence of the harm-causing item, in this case the snake, on the defendant's property, without any negligence on the part of the defendant. The mere escape of the snake, without more, was sufficient for the worker to prevail.",
        "answer_b": "An owner of a wild animal or an abnormally dangerous animal is strictly liable for harm caused by that animal's dangerous nature. Even though the snake was defanged, the worker had no reason to know this; his injury falls within the risk run by the homeowner because it was caused by the worker's foreseeable reaction to seeing the escaped snake.",
        "comparison_result": "[New Evaluation]\n\nExplanation A seems to overstate the facts by implying that the homeowner's negligence is not a factor. However, this is not necessarily true because the homeowner did have a responsibility to ensure the snake was safely contained.

        "question": "A buyer validly contracted in writing to buy land from a seller. The contract had no contingencies and was silent as to risk of loss if there were damage to, or destruction of, property improvements between contract and closing, and as to any duty to carry insurance. As soon as the parties signed the contract, the seller (who had already moved out) canceled her insurance covering the land. The buyer did not know this and did not obtain insurance. A few days later, three weeks before the agreed closing date, the building on the land was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. There is no applicable statute. In an appropriate action, the buyer asserted the right to cancel the contract and to recover his earnest money. The seller said the risk of fire loss passed to the buyer before the fire, so the buyer must perform. If the seller prevails, what is the most likely explanation?",

This explanation is more coherent and provides a clear argument for why the seller should prevail. \n\nExplanation B is less persuasive because it only states the legal principle that the risk of loss falls on the equitable owner of the property, without explaining why this principle applies in this case.

The clerk agreed, saying, \"I know I can trust someone like you with the merchandise.\" The customer walked out of the store wearing the watch and never returned. A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must either pay for the watch or give it back.

At common law, larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of it, without the owner's permission or consent.

Answer C is incorrect because false pretenses is the incorrect charge to have raised, since no false statement was made; the customer believed his statement to be true. Answer D is incorrect because, although the customer's subsequent threats were done with the intent to intimidate, they were not done with the intent to permanently deprive the clerk of the watch, and thus were not larceny.",

The statute also provided that public proceedings must precede adoption of the standards, and that once they were adopted, the standards would be subject to judicial review.

Several officials of the National Bureau of Standards have indicated their personal preference for beer produced by a special brewing process commonly referred to as pasteurization. However, these officials have not indicated whether they intend to include a requirement for pasteurization in the minimum beer quality standards to be adopted by the Bureau. A brewery that produces an unpasteurized beer believes that its brewing process is as safe as pasteurization.

Should the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?",
        "answer_a": " The customer's claim is that the grocer negligently placed the banana peel on the floor, which caused the customer to slip and fall. The customer's argument is that, since the peel was fresh and clean except for the mark from the customer's shoe, it must have been recently placed there, and thus the grocer was negligent in allowing it to be there. To succeed in his claim, the customer must first show that the grocer had a duty to him. The facts suggest that the grocer was a vendor of bananas, and the customer was a customer. Vendors owe a duty to customers to have their products in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's next argument is that the grocer's knowledge or should-have-known of the banana peel is not relevant to the determination of the grocer's negligence. That is incorrect. A vendor is charged with knowing any unreasonable risks posed by the goods that he or she has offered for sale. A person who offers goods for sale has a duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the goods are in a reasonably safe condition.

A person who offers goods for sale may be held liable for any foreseeable injuries caused by those goods. The fact that the banana peel was fresh and clean, except for a mark from the customer's shoe, is a strong indication that the peel was recently placed there, and thus the grocer's failure to detect it was negligent.

        "question": "The United States Congress enacted a federal statute providing that any state may \"require labeling to show the state or other geographic origin of citrus fruit that is imported into the receiving state.\" Pursuant to the federal statute, a state that produced large quantities of citrus fruit enacted a law requiring all citrus fruit imported into the state to be stamped with a two-letter postal abbreviation signifying the state of the fruit's origin. The law did not impose any such requirement for citrus fruit grown within the state. When it adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose was to reduce the risks of infection of local citrus crops by itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A national association of citrus growers sued to have the state law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the law is prohibited by the negative implications of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in favor of the state's effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?",

The uncle replied that he would lend the money to the nephew only if the nephew's mother \"guaranteed\" the loan. At the nephew's suggestion, the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother, told her about the loan, and asked if she would \"guarantee\" it. She replied, \"Surely. Lend my son the $4,000 and I'll repay it if he doesn't.\" The uncle then lent $4,000 to the nephew, an amount the nephew orally agreed to repay in six weeks.

Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions.

In defense, the defendant called a witness to testify, \"I have been the plaintiff's neighbor for many years, and people in our community generally have said that he is a thief.\" Is the testimony concerning the plaintiff's reputation in the community admissible?",
        "answer_a": " Because slander is a false statement claim, one of the most important elements for the plaintiff to prove is that the statement was false. Because of this, character evidence is admissible both to prove that the statement was false (by proving that the person is not a thief) and to prove the damages (by showing that a false statement has a tendency to injure one's reputation). Thus, answer B is correct.",
        "answer_b": "In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects: First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages.

The lease has a year to run, and the student is still living in the apartment. The student has sued the landlord for trespass to land. Is he likely to prevail?",
        "answer_a": " The law gives a landlord the right to enter a tenant's apartment to make repairs, to inspect the property, or to show the apartment to prospective purchasers. This right, however, is limited by the landlord's duty not to interfere with the tenant's use or enjoyment of the property.

A public nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable non-trespassory interference with the use or enjoyment of a large number of persons. Since the woman is being exposed to the non-trespassory interference, she may bring a claim for the public nuisance, although the number of people exposed to the nuisance would have to be determined.

The buyer was unable to do so, but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller. Will the buyer prevail?",
        "answer_a": " A duty of performance is conditioned upon the happening of the event when the language of the contract indicates that the performance is to be subject to an express condition. The express language of the buyer-seller contract indicated that the buyer's obligation to perform was subject to an express condition. However, an express condition will be excused if it is not performed within a reasonable time, in which case the party who is to have benefited by the condition's performance may elect to either terminate his own liability or waive the condition by proceeding under the contract.

[Reasoning] Explanation B is better than Explanation A because it includes the additional fact that the neighbor did not expend any money, property, or labor pursuant to the agreement. This fact is crucial because the neighbor's lack of expenditure is a key factor in determining whether the neighbor has a license or an easement. If the neighbor had expended any money, property, or labor pursuant to the agreement, the neighbor would have had an easement, which would have been non-revocable. However, because the neighbor did not expend any money, property, or labor, the neighbor's agreement with the landowner was a license, which is revocable. Therefore, the grantee was able to effectively revoke the neighbor's license and prohibit the neighbor from using the road. [Analysis] The key to this question is understanding the difference between a license and an easement. A license is a revocable permission to use the land of another, while an easement is a non-revocable right to use the land of another. If the neighbor had expended any money, property, or labor pursuant to the agreement, the neighbor would have had an easement, which would have been non-revocable. However, because the neighbor did not expend any money, property, or labor, the neighbor's agreement with the landowner was a license, which is revocable.

In contrast, Explanation B takes a modern law approach, considering breach of contract as a wrong against the injured party, who is entitled to recover damages to compensate for the loss resulting from the breach.\n\nExplanation A provides a clear and concise explanation of the common law perspective on breach of contract, which is still relevant in modern law. However, it does not address the specific question of the carpenter's measure of recovery, instead focusing on the general concept of breach of contract.\n\nExplanation B directly addresses the carpenter's measure of recovery, stating that the carpenter is entitled to the contract price for the work done. This explanation also addresses the issue of unforeseeable damages and the limitation on unjust enrichment claims, which are relevant to the carpenter's situation.\n\nIn terms of coherence, Explanation A is clear and well-organized, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. Explanation B is also well-organized and provides a clear answer to the question, but it could be more concise.\n\nOverall, while both explanations have their strengths and weaknesses, Explanation B is more directly relevant to the question and provides a clearer answer. Therefore, the final verdict is:\n\n[B]  The carpenter is entitled to the contract price for the work done. The other items of damage are unrecoverable either because they were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made or because they were not caused by the breach. No unjust enrichment claim is viable on these facts, because an unjust enrichment claim cannot exceed the contract price when all of the work giving rise to the claim has been done and the only remaining obligation is the payment of the price. This limitation on unjust enrichment claims was recapitulated in the well known case of Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954), and represents the current rule in such cases.

        "question": "A plaintiff sued her employer, alleging that poor working conditions had caused her to develop a stomach ulcer. At trial, the plaintiff's medical expert testified to the cause of the plaintiff's ulcer and stated that his opinion was based in part on information in a letter the plaintiff's personal physician had written to the plaintiff's employer, explaining why the plaintiff had missed work. When offered to prove the cause of the plaintiff's condition, is the letter from the plaintiff's doctor admissible?",
        "answer_a": " The doctor's letter is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition was caused by her work environment. The doctor's letter is thus hearsay, and, because it does not meet the requirements of any exception, it is inadmissible.",
        "answer_b": "The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay.",
