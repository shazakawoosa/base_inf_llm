        "answer_a": " When a court finds that a party has breached a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages in accordance with the contract terms. Where the breaching party has committed a total breach of contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that are intended to place the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied but for the breach. In this case, the parties contracted for the teacher to work 10 weeks at the summer camp for $10,000. When the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else to act as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed, the camp had committed a total breach of contract. Therefore, the teacher should recover damages in the amount of $10,000.",
        "answer_b": "The teacher is entitled to be put in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. Application of this principle leads to recovery of the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), PLUS the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 travel expenses). Mitigation expenses can be recovered, if reasonable, even if those particular expenses are not connected to a successful mitigation attempt.",

The friend was then in privity of estate with the landlord as to all promises that run with the land, including the covenant to pay rent. The tenant was not released by the landlord, however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract.",

        "answer_a": " The commerce clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and, by negative implication, restricts the regulatory power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. Protectionism is a policy of protecting domestic producers from foreign competition by imposing restrictions on imports. A protectionist policy is prohibited by the commerce clause. A state law that has a protectionist effect on interstate commerce is invalid. A state law that has an adverse effect on interstate commerce, even if it is not protectionist, is invalid if it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce. The test for determining whether a state law has an adverse effect on interstate commerce is whether it has a substantial effect on the economy of the interstate market. A state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market is invalid if it is not necessary to serve a legitimate state interest. A state law that protects the health or safety of its residents is considered to serve a legitimate state interest. Therefore, a state law that has a substantial effect on the interstate market in toys is invalid unless it is necessary to protect the health or safety of the state's residents. Protecting the health and safety of the state's residents justifies any burden on the interstate toy market, so a state law that has a substantial effect on that market is valid if it is designed to protect the health and safety of the state's residents. In this case, the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that the toys it sells satisfy scientific criteria justifies the burden on the interstate toy market. Therefore, the law is constitutional.",

Any state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce must not be protectionist or otherwise impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A protectionist law benefits in-state interests at the expense of out-of-state interests. A state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist unless it serves a legitimate local interest that cannot be served by nondiscriminatory legislation. By barring the sale in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the state law has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate against the out-of-state toy manufacturers, it has a purely discriminatory effect against them, and the state has less discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate interests cited in the law. The state law therefore violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.",

The drug dealer's agreement to sell the cocaine, even if sincere, was not a substantial step because it was part of an ongoing negotiation that was to continue for 10 days and it was not a step that had any natural tendency to bring about the commission of the crime. In modern statutory jurisdictions, however, attempt requires only that the defendant have the intent to commit the crime and that the defendant take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense.

See, e.g., People v. Warren, 489 N.E.2d 240 (N.Y. 1985) (finding no common law attempt on much stronger facts for prosecution than this fact pattern). Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no \"substantial step\" toward commission of the crime.

After the financing company was paid in full from the funds generated by the foreclosure sale of its mortgage on the parking garage, the additional funds generated by that sale would be paid to the bank not as a deficiency judgment, but because of the unsatisfied amount of the prior money judgment.",

They are probative of the defendant's guilt because they involve the same method of fraud as that in the current case. In addition, because the crimes are similar, the jury is likely to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's prior convictions. The fact that the crimes are punishable by the same penalty (a fine and/or imprisonment) is also probative and supports the use of the convictions to impeach the defendant. Finally, the fact that the crimes involve dishonesty is probative and supports the use of the convictions to prove that the defendant committed the crime.

If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Note that the courts require that the cross-examiner must have a good faith belief that the event actually occurred before inquiring into the act on cross-examination.

The customer's argument is that, since the peel was fresh and clean except for the mark from the customer's shoe, it must have been recently placed there, and thus the grocer was negligent in allowing it to be there. To succeed in his claim, the customer must first show that the grocer had a duty to him. The facts suggest that the grocer was a vendor of bananas, and the customer was a customer. Vendors owe a duty to customers to have their products in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's next argument is that the grocer's knowledge or should-have-known of the banana peel is not relevant to the determination of the grocer's negligence. That is incorrect. A vendor is charged with knowing any unreasonable risks posed by the goods that he or she has offered for sale. A person who offers goods for sale has a duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the goods are in a reasonably safe condition. The customer's final argument is that the grocer could foresee that a customer might slip on a banana peel. That is correct. A person who offers goods for sale may be held liable for any foreseeable injuries caused by those goods. The fact that the banana peel was fresh and clean, except for a mark from the customer's shoe, is a strong indication that the peel was recently placed there, and thus the grocer's failure to detect it was negligent.

Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched; but if the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character and to the extent of damages.

The facts indicate that the woman is being exposed to a non-trespassory interference with the use and enjoyment of her land, i.e., the noise and bright lights. Therefore, the woman is entitled to relief for the private nuisance. A public nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable non-trespassory interference with the use or enjoyment of a large number of persons. Since the woman is being exposed to the non-trespassory interference, she may bring a claim for the public nuisance, although the number of people exposed to the nuisance would have to be determined. Waste is the wrong doctrine to apply, because the woman is not being exposed to an excess of waste material on her land. Damages for a private nuisance may be recovered if they are necessary to restore the woman's use and enjoyment of her land. In addition, damages may be recovered for public nuisances.",
        "answer_b": "Damages may be awarded if a private nuisance is proven. A private nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of one's land. The facts demonstrate a non-trespassory invasion of the woman's property rights.",

The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder.

        "answer_a": " At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful or lawful goal, where the co-conspirators intend that their conduct constitute a crime. A co-conspirator need not agree to all objects of the conspiracy nor need the co-conspirators agree to the exact means of accomplishing the goal; there is unity of purpose among the conspirators. Further, at common law, a conspirator is not required to be present at the commission of each crime, nor is the conspiracy itself a single crime. So long as there is an initial agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of criminal conduct constituting all the bank robberies, there is a conspiracy, and the defendant cannot be convicted of the six bank robberies he did not commit.",

        "answer_a": " A duty of performance is conditioned upon the happening of the event when the language of the contract indicates that the performance is to be subject to an express condition. The express language of the buyer-seller contract indicated that the buyer's obligation to perform was subject to an express condition. However, an express condition will be excused if it is not performed within a reasonable time, in which case the party who is to have benefited by the condition's performance may elect to either terminate his own liability or waive the condition by proceeding under the contract. In this case, the facts indicate that the buyer obtained a loan at an interest rate of 10.5%. Because the seller refused to perform, the buyer should prevail. Thus, answer D is correct.",
        "answer_b": "Courts look beyond the words of a condition, and if it is clear that the purpose of the condition was to benefit or protect one of the parties, the language of the condition will be interpreted as if that intention had been embodied in the contract terms. In this case it is clear that the language of the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer, and so the seller's duty was not subject to the condition.",

At common law, breach of contract was regarded as a wrong against the owner of the promise, and the remedy for such a wrong was considered to be the recovery of damages to compensate the owner for the loss resulting from the breach. In modern law, breach of contract is regarded as a wrong against the injured party, who is entitled to recover damages to compensate him or her for the loss resulting from the breach.

The other items of damage are unrecoverable either because they were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made or because they were not caused by the breach.

        "answer_a": " The doctor's letter is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff's condition was caused by her work environment. The doctor's letter is thus hearsay, and, because it does not meet the requirements of any exception, it is inadmissible.",
        "answer_b": "The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay.",
